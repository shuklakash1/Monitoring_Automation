# Monitoring_Automation
This a hero vired course assignment which needed to create an automated infrastructure of AWS using boto3 

Please find this README as an important notice for the code submitted on the assignment. A lot of things have been hardcoded and a few of the things had to be manually done on the AWS console itself. This is why a word documentation has been created even when there was no requirement so I could help explain the process of how I've gone about with it. This might not be the expected result of the assignment but I've tried it to the best of my ability to achieve that. 

Thank You.
